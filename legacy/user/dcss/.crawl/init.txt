##### Crawl Init file ###############################################
# For descriptions of all options, as well as some more in-depth information
# on setting them, consult the file
#    options_guide.txt
# in your /docs directory. If you can't find it, the file is also available
# online at:
# https://github.com/crawl/crawl/blob/master/crawl-ref/docs/options_guide.txt
#
# Crawl uses the first file of the following list as its option file:
#  * init.txt in the -rcdir directory (if specified)
#  * .crawlrc in the -rcdir directory (if specified)
#  * init.txt (in the Crawl directory)
#  * ~/.crawl/init.txt (Unix only)
#  * ~/.crawlrc (Unix only)
#  * ~/init.txt (Unix only)
#  * settings/init.txt (in the Crawl directory)

##### Some basic explanation of option syntax #######################
# Lines beginning with '#' are comments. The basic syntax is:
#
# field = value         or      field.subfield = value
#
# Only one specification is allowed per line.
#
# The terms are typically case-insensitive except in the fairly obvious
# cases (the character's name and specifying files or directories when
# on a system that has case-sensitive filenames).
#
# White space is stripped from the beginning and end of the line, as
# well as immediately before and after the '='. If the option allows
# multiple comma/semicolon-separated terms (such as
# autopickup_exceptions), all whitespace around the separator is also
# trimmed. All other whitespace is left intact.
#
# There are three broad types of Crawl options: true/false values (booleans),
# arbitrary values, and lists of values. The first two types use only the
# simple =, with later options - which includes your options that are different
# from the defaults - overriding earlier ones. List options allow using +=, ^=,
# -=, and = to append, prepend, remove, and reset, respectively. Usually you will
# want to use += to add to a list option. Lastly, there is := which you can use
# to create an alias, like so:
#   ae := autopickup_exceptions
# From there on, 'ae' will be treated as if it you typed autopickup_exceptions,
# so you can save time typing it.
#

##### Other files ###################################################
# You can include other files from your options file using the 'include'
# option. Crawl will treat it as if you copied the whole text of that file
# into your options file in that spot. You can uncomment some of the following
# lines by removing the beginning '#' to include some of the other files in
# this folder.

# Some useful, more advanced options, implemented in LUA.
# include = advanced_optioneering.txt

# Alternative vi bindings for Dvorak users.
# include = dvorak_command_keys.txt

# Alternative vi bindings for Colemak users.
# include = colemak_command_keys.txt

# Override the vi movement keys with a non-command.
# include = no_vi_command_keys.txt

# Turn the shift-vi keys into safe move, instead of run.
# include = safe_move_shift.txt

##### Ancient versions ##############################################
# If you're used to the interface of ancient versions of Crawl, you may
# get back parts of it by uncommenting the following options:

# include                 = 034_command_keys.txt

# And to revert monster glyph and colouring changes:

# include                 = 052_monster_glyphs.txt
# include                 = 060_monster_glyphs.txt
# include                 = 071_monster_glyphs.txt
# include                 = 080_monster_glyphs.txt
# include                 = 0.9_monster_glyphs.txt
# include                 = 0.12_monster_glyphs.txt
# include                 = 0.13_monster_glyphs.txt
# include                 = 0.14_monster_glyphs.txt
